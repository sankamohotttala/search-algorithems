# search-algorithems
Basic search algorithms in C
These are some of the basic algorithems i wrote for the DSA class i took in university.
they are written using codeblocks software.
Some of these codes contain a sleep function in order to analyse the time complexity.
Header folder contains two header files and users should include these files in the "src"(source) folder without changing their names.
If they directy use the code folders then no need to add headers since they are already incorparated inside those folders.
Comments and suggestions are truely welcome..!!!
If you guys have anything to add to this repository please let me know. :)
