# search-algorithems
Basic search algorithms in C
These are some of the basic algorithems i wrote for the DSA class i took in university.
they are written using codeblocks software.
They contain a sleep function in order to analyse the time complexity.
there are two header files and users should include these files in the "src"(source) folder without changing their names.
